# OSKmanager — backend

## Notes for developers working on the project

* ### What should I do locally before sending new *pull request*?

  Simply run the command `mvn clean verify` – you may send your pull request only if the project is successfully built
  after this command.

* ### How many *approvals* do I need for my pull request to *merge* it into the master branch?

  Two approvals are needed to merge a *pull request* into the master branch. Remember that you may merge your code into
  the master branch provided it passes `mvn clean verify` command.

Remember that on our main Discord channel you may ask questions in case anything is unclear to you.
We are there to help you :)
